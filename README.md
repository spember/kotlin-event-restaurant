## Event Sourced Restaurant

This is another attempt at creating an application utilizating Event Sourcing and DDD-esque principles. This time, I'm
doing it to learn a bit of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and the [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) framework.

#### Project Structure


#### Todos:

This is all still very much a work in progress that I'll tinker with as I have time. Lots of things to do here, including:

* wiring up a sql / postgres module to replace the 'inmemory' storage
* exploring kotlin coroutines and utilizing them if applicable
* some form of front-end
